#fromthetransistor
Copied from geohot's fromthetransistor, me actually attempting to do it.

## Intro
* I don't think that programming experience is required, but Googling skills would be helpful
* Current Requirements
	* A computer
	* Some basic critical thinking skills
	* Minecraft. Literally just minecraft.
# Process

1. Make an ALU by yourself (1 - 2 weeks)
	* Goal: Learn HDL, learn how to get from a transistor to something that resembles a computer
	* Learn basic logic gates
 	* https://www.nand2tetris.org/project01 do this. Not all of it, probably just skim and maybe do one of the 16-bit things
	* I honestly don't know why geohot didn't include this in his, but he's a noob
	* The best way that I've found to do this is Minecraft. It's quick, easy,and redstone makes sense.
	* Make an ALU by yourself, should be pretty easy, 1-2 weeks. Could get done in an afternoon, try doing it by yourself and only use Internet when you need to.
