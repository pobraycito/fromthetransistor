# fromthetransistor
Copied from geohot's fromthetransistor, me actually attempting to do it.

## Intro
* I don't think that programming experience is required, but Googling skills would be helpful
* Current Requirements
	* A UNIX terminal of some sort (WSL, MacOS, or native Linux works)
	* Minecraft. Literally just minecraft.
# Process

1. Learn logic gates, and the actual transistor
	* I honestly don't know why geohot didn't include this in his, but he's a noob
	* The best way that I've found to do this is Minecraft. It's quick, easy,and redstone makes sense.
	* Make an ALU by yourself, should be pretty easy, 1-2 weeks. Could get done in an afternoon, try doing it by yourself and only use Internet when you need to.
	* https://www.nand2tetris.org/project01 do this. Not all of it, probably just skim and maybe do one of the 16-bit things.
