Copied from geohot's fromthetransistor, me actually attempting to do it.

## Process

1. Learn logic gates, and the actual transistor
	* The best way that I've found to do this is Minecraft. It's quick, easy,and redstone makes sense.
	* Make an ALU by yourself, should be pretty easy, 1-2 weeks. Could get done in an afternoon, try doing it by yourself and only use Internet when you need to.
